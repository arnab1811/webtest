    <h1>Steps to Setup a Community Seed Bank</h1>
    <div class="textbox">
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h1>Community Engagement</h1>
                <p>Start by discussing the idea with the community. Explain the purpose, benefits, and responsibilities involved in maintaining a seed bank. Gather support and get a committed group of individuals to help.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h1>Selecting a Suitable Location</h1>
                <p>Choose a location that is easily accessible and has appropriate conditions for seed storage. This could be a dedicated building or part of an existing community facility.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h1><a href="https://mgsantaclara.ucanr.edu/garden-help/vegetables/vegetable-garden-basics/seed-saving-basics/" target="_blank">Seed Collection</a></h1>
                <p>Collect seeds from the local area, focusing on native, heirloom, or locally adapted varieties. This could involve community seed collection events or donations from local gardeners.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h1>Seed Storage</h1>
                <p>Package and store seeds properly to maintain their viability. This often involves drying the seeds, packaging them in airtight containers, and storing them in a cool, dark place.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h1>Record Keeping</h1>
                <p>Keep detailed records of the seeds in the bank, including the variety, source, collection date, and any other relevant information. This helps track the seeds in the bank and provides valuable information for those who use them.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h1>Community Education and Outreach</h1>
                <p>Regularly host workshops or events to educate the community about the seed bank and promote its use. This could include seed swapping events, gardening workshops, or presentations about seed saving.</p>
            </li>
